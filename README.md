# Eslint setup for programming beginners

## Setup
- You'll need to download [.eslintrc](./.eslintrc) to your home directory
  - **Windows** `C:\Users\PUT_YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE\.eslintrc.js`
  - **Mac/Linux** `~/.eslintrc` (`/home/PUT_YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE/.eslintrc.js`)
- [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/download) `node` if you haven't already
- Install `eslint` globally if you haven't already
  - run `npm i -g eslint` in `cmd`, `powershell` or `bash`
- Linting
  - Set up an editor integration
    - [vscode eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - Or lint files via the command line `eslint FILE_I_WANT_TO_LINE.js`

## Rationale
Relatively easy to set up linting which prevents some common errors and helps beginner programmers develop some good habits while reducing their cognitive load a bit.
